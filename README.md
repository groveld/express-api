## TODO

- come up with best way to name files (best practices)
- setup mysql database so i can start using user authentication and have no more secrets in sourcecode
- use redis cache for ratelimiter and for jwt tokens?
- update cors middleware to use regex array for domains so any subdomain could be accepted
- decide on best rate limiting settings to use in production
